# Discrete Math Project -- Zane McMorris
This repo contains the Python source code for my Discrete Math final project. To run the project, simply use Python 3 on the python file and import any missing dependencies.
Environment variables can be changed in the python source to change the board size, timeout duration, and generation delay. Runs in a GUI and can record results to a file.
